# Animator Beta Addon
This is an addon with additional series for the official redesign Animator branch.
These series are largely based on their counterparts from The Fool, but with adjustments made to conform to the mechanics of the official redesign branch.

Installation Instructions:
- Install StsLib, ModTheSpire, and BaseMod (these can be gotten from the Steam workshop. If you have the GOG version, follow these steps instead: https://reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/gj5kel/howto_add_mods_to_gog_version/)
- Download the latest version of the official Animator mod from the Animator Discord server and place it into your mods folder (usually {folder containing STS}\SlayTheSpire\mods)
- Download the mod from the link above and place in the same folder that you placed the official redesign mod
- Run ModTheSpire. Ensure that StsLib, BaseMod, and The Animator are checked and appear above this mod in the mod load order
