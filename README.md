# Animator Beta Addon
This is an addon with additional series for the official redesign Animator branch. It uses many of the same cards but pits them in a different set of game mechanics.

Installation Instructions:
- Install StsLib, ModTheSpire, and BaseMod (these can be gotten from the Steam workshop. If you have the GOG version, follow these steps instead: https://reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/gj5kel/howto_add_mods_to_gog_version/)
- Download the latest version of the official Animator mod from the Animator Discord server and place it into your mods folder (usually {folder containing STS}\SlayTheSpire\mods)
- Download the mod from the link above and place in the same folder that you placed the official redesign mod
- Run ModTheSpire. Ensure that StsLib, BaseMod, and The Animator are checked and appear above The Animator Beta in the mod load order
